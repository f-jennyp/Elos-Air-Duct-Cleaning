            <h1>How we clean air ducts</h1>

            <p>
                How do we clean the air ducts coming from your heating/cooling system?
                We go to each individual vent in your home with both compressed air AND the vacuum system. If you have
                10 vents in your home, we vacuum and clean from 10 separate areas.
                By cleaning in a smaller section of ductwork at a time, we maintain a higher air volume in the ducts,
                resulting in a much better duct cleaning. This is how we differ from a negative air pressure duct
                cleaning. With over $20,000 of professional duct cleaning equipment, we get the job done right for you.
